# Raindrops-OpenGL
This is a mathematical game based on OpenGL and C++ . Raindrops with simple mathematical equations will be moving vertically downwards and the user has to type the right answer before it reaches the bottom. The drops will progressively speed up as the user enters right answers.
If the user leaves the drop 3 times, the game will be ended and final score will be calculated.
